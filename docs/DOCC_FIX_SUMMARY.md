# DocC Documentation Fix Summary

## Problem

The DocC documentation website was only showing the articles from the `SwiftXDAV.docc` catalog, but not showing any of the actual API documentation (classes, methods, properties, etc.) from the source code files.

## Root Cause

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/documentation.yml`) was only building documentation for the `SwiftXDAV` umbrella module, which contains:
- The `.docc` catalog with articles
- Re-exports of all types via `@_exported import`

However, DocC doesn't automatically pull in documentation from re-exported modules. The umbrella module's documentation catalog was referencing symbols like `` ``CalDAVClient`` `` that don't actually exist in the SwiftXDAV module itself—they're defined in `SwiftXDAVCalendar`, `SwiftXDAVNetwork`, etc.

## Solution

### 1. Updated SwiftXDAV.docc/SwiftXDAV.md

Changed the "Topics" section to describe the framework architecture instead of trying to reference symbols that aren't in the umbrella module:

**Before:**
```markdown
### CalDAV
- ``CalDAVClient``  # ❌ Can't find this symbol
- ``Calendar``      # ❌ Can't find this symbol
```

**After:**
```markdown
### Framework Architecture

#### SwiftXDAVCalendar
CalDAV client, iCalendar (RFC 5545) parser, calendar and event models...

Key types: `CalDAVClient`, `Calendar`, `VEvent`, ...
```

This provides a clear overview while using plain markdown code formatting instead of symbol links.

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

Changed the workflow to build documentation for **all** modules separately:

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Build Documentation
  run: |
    swift package --allow-writing-to-directory ./.docc-build \
      generate-documentation \
      --target SwiftXDAV \
      ...
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Build Documentation for All Modules
  run: |
    # Build each module separately
    swift package ... --target SwiftXDAV ...
    swift package ... --target SwiftXDAVCalendar ...
    swift package ... --target SwiftXDAVContacts ...
    swift package ... --target SwiftXDAVNetwork ...
    swift package ... --target SwiftXDAVCore ...

    # Create index.html with links to all modules
    cat > .docc-build/index.html << 'EOF'
    ...
    EOF
```

Each module now gets its own `.doccarchive` in a subdirectory:
- `.docc-build/SwiftXDAV/` - Main module with articles
- `.docc-build/SwiftXDAVCalendar/` - **Contains all CalDAV API docs** ✅
- `.docc-build/SwiftXDAVContacts/` - **Contains all CardDAV API docs** ✅
- `.docc-build/SwiftXDAVNetwork/` - **Contains all WebDAV/HTTP API docs** ✅
- `.docc-build/SwiftXDAVCore/` - **Contains all core types API docs** ✅

### 3. Added Index Page

Created an `index.html` that:
- Redirects to the main SwiftXDAV documentation by default
- Provides links to all module documentation

## Result

When the documentation is published to GitHub Pages, users will now see:

1. **Landing Page** (`/swiftxdav/`) - Redirects to main documentation with article links
2. **Main Module** (`/swiftxdav/SwiftXDAV/`) - Overview, getting started, guides
3. **Calendar Module** (`/swiftxdav/SwiftXDAVCalendar/`) - All CalDAV/iCalendar APIs ✅
4. **Contacts Module** (`/swiftxdav/SwiftXDAVContacts/`) - All CardDAV/vCard APIs ✅
5. **Network Module** (`/swiftxdav/SwiftXDAVNetwork/`) - All WebDAV/HTTP APIs ✅
6. **Core Module** (`/swiftxdav/SwiftXDAVCore/`) - All core types APIs ✅

Each module's documentation will include:
- All public classes, structs, enums
- All public methods and properties
- All DocC comments from source files
- Full API reference

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to the repository
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the updated documentation
3. Verify that all API documentation is visible at `https://daniosif.github.io/swiftxdav/`

## Technical Details

### Why This Approach?

DocC's `swift-docc-plugin` doesn't support building unified documentation for multi-module Swift Packages with re-exported modules. The recommended approach is to either:

1. Build each module separately (our solution)
2. Use a monolithic module structure (not desirable for large frameworks)
3. Wait for future DocC improvements for better multi-module support

### Module Organization

The multi-module approach provides several benefits:
- Users can import only what they need (`import SwiftXDAVCalendar`)
- Better build time isolation
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Each module has its own focused documentation

### Documentation Links

Users can navigate between modules using:
- The index page with module links
- The main SwiftXDAV documentation describing each module
- Direct URLs to specific modules
