# Phase 11: Advanced Features - Implementation Progress

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (Partial - Scheduling deferred to future work)
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Completion:** 2 of 3 major features (Recurrence Engine ✅, Timezone Support ✅, Scheduling ⏭️)

## Overview

Phase 11 implements advanced features for CalDAV including:
- Recurrence rule expansion (RRULE)
- Comprehensive timezone handling
- CalDAV scheduling extensions (RFC 6638)
- iTIP support for meeting invitations

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Recurrence Engine ⏳

Implement RFC 5545 compliant recurrence rule expansion:

**Features to implement:**
- Expand RRULE into concrete occurrence dates
- Handle all recurrence frequencies (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY, etc.)
- Support BYDAY, BYMONTH, BYMONTHDAY, BYSETPOS rules
- Handle COUNT and UNTIL limits
- Process EXDATE (exception dates) and RDATE (additional dates)
- Handle timezone-aware recurrence
- Edge cases: last day of month, leap years, DST transitions

**Files to create:**
- `Sources/SwiftXDAVCalendar/Recurrence/RecurrenceEngine.swift` - Main expansion engine
- `Sources/SwiftXDAVCalendar/Recurrence/RecurrenceIterator.swift` - Iterator for occurrences
- `Tests/SwiftXDAVCalendarTests/RecurrenceEngineTests.swift` - Comprehensive tests

### 2. Timezone Support ⏳

Enhance timezone handling beyond basic offsets:

**Features to implement:**
- Parse and use VTIMEZONE components properly
- Convert between timezones for recurring events
- Handle DST transitions correctly
- Support floating time (no timezone)
- Support UTC time
- Integration with Foundation TimeZone
- Timezone database fallback

**Files to create:**
- `Sources/SwiftXDAVCalendar/Timezone/TimezoneHandler.swift` - Timezone utilities

### 3. CalDAV Scheduling (RFC 6638) ⏳

Implement scheduling extensions for meeting invitations:

**Features to implement:**
- iTIP METHOD support (REQUEST, REPLY, CANCEL, etc.)
- Schedule inbox/outbox discovery
- Send meeting invitations
- Process meeting responses
- Handle participant status updates
- Free/busy time queries
- Schedule-tag support

**Files to create:**

## Notes

- RFC 5545 Section 3.3.10 defines recurrence rules

## Next Steps

### Phase 12 - Enhanced Scope

Phase 12 has been expanded beyond the original plan to include:

1. **Google API Direct Integration** ⭐ NEW
   - Google Calendar API v3 client (instead of CalDAV)
   - Google People API client (instead of CardDAV)
   - OAuth 2.0 authentication
   - Better performance and features than Google's CalDAV/CardDAV

2. **GitHub Pages Documentation Pipeline** ⭐ NEW
   - Automated DocC generation
   - Published to GitHub Pages
   - Versioned documentation

3. **Test Quality Standards** ⭐ NEW
   - NO disabled tests in codebase
   - All tests must pass
   - CI fails if tests are disabled

4. **Original Phase 12 Items**
   - Comprehensive unit tests (>80% coverage)
   - Integration tests against real servers
   - Full DocC documentation
   - Example application

See `docs/PHASE_12_REQUIREMENTS.md` for complete details.

## Deferred Features

### CalDAV Scheduling Extensions (RFC 6638)

CalDAV scheduling (iTIP, meeting invitations, free/busy) has been **deferred to future work** because:

1. **Optional Extension:** RFC 6638 is an optional CalDAV extension, not required for core functionality
2. **Limited Server Support:** Not all CalDAV servers implement scheduling extensions
3. **Basic Operations Work:** Event CRUD operations already work via standard CalDAV
4. **Complexity:** Scheduling is complex and deserves dedicated focus as a separate feature
5. **Priority:** Google API integration and documentation are higher priority for Phase 12

**When to implement:**
- As a post-1.0 feature enhancement
- When user demand requires it
- As a separate module (e.g., `SwiftXDAVScheduling`)

**What works without scheduling:**
- ✅ Creating events with organizer and attendees
- ✅ Updating event status
- ✅ Reading attendee information
- ✅ All basic CalDAV operations

**What requires scheduling:**
- ❌ Sending meeting invitations via CalDAV
- ❌ Processing meeting responses via CalDAV
- ❌ Free/busy queries via CalDAV
- ❌ Schedule inbox/outbox operations

**Alternative:** Applications can send meeting invitations via email (with iTIP attachments) or use server-specific APIs like Google Calendar API which handles scheduling server-side.
